This software must be installed in a Ubuntu distribution. In order to use the parallel 
(distributed memory MPI based) application you need:

-> OpenMPI

It is recommended to install "libopenmpi-dev" using the Synaptic Package Manager. Or via terminal with:

% sudo apt-get install libopenmpi-dev

An additional option is MPICH using

% sudo apt-get install mpich

-> BLAS, LAPACK, zlib1g BISON and FLEX libraries with:

% sudo apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev zlib1g-dev bison flex

-> BESLE compilation

The MPI path is needed in the installation of SCOTCH, then a default path is provided at line 4 of the file Makefile.inc located at

%~/BESLE_ROOT/MUMPS/scotch/src+

The path is given by the flag \verb+MPIPATH+ 

MPIPATH = -I/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/mpich+

To verify this path in the user's system, e.g., use

% whereis mpich+

To build the BESLE application

%~/BESLE$ make+

Now, standalone installation is completed! In order to delete all the generated files during compilation and restore the state as before any installation, use the command:

%~/BESLE$ make uninstall+
