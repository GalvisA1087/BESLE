This software must be installed in a Ubuntu distribution. In order to use the parallel 
(distributed memory MPI based) application you need:

-> OpenMPI

It is recommended to install "libopenmpi-dev" using the Synaptic Package Manager. Or via terminal with:

% sudo apt-get install libopenmpi-dev

An additional option is MPICH using

% sudo apt-get install mpich

-> BLAS, LAPACK, zlib1g BISON and FLEX libraries with:

% sudo apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev zlib1g-dev bison flex

-> GIT Necessary for the online installer download and clone the packages.

% sudo apt install git-all

-> BESLE compilation

The BESLE application needs the use of 3rd party software (MUMPS,
SCOTCH, SCALAPACK, VORO++ and TRIANGLE). These packages are downloaded 
through the GitHub hosting platform. The downloads are launched using the command 

%~/BESLE$ make get+

To perform correctly the installation needs that every package be placed in a specific location with the proper configuration files. This pattern is gotten by using the command:

%~/BESLE$ make prepare+

The MPI path is needed in the installation of SCOTCH, then a default path is provided at line 4 of the file Makefile.inc.scotch located at

%~/BESLE_ROOT/Make.inc+

\noindent The path is given by the flag \verb+MPIPATH+ 

MPIPATH = -I/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/mpich+

To verify this path in the user's system, e.g., use

% whereis mpich+

To build the BESLE application

%~/BESLE$ make install+

Now, the installation is completed! In order to delete all the generated files during compilation and restore the state as before any installation, use the command:

%~/BESLE$ make uninstall+
